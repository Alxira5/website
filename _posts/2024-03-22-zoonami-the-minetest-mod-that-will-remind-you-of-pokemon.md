Surely you have remembered the Pokémon series or one of its video games, in my
case it is one of my favorite series. Today I will talk to you about a very
particular mod for [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/), which allows us to
have an experience very similar to that of Pokémon.

## Zoonami, a very particular mod

Zoonami is a mod for Minetest developed by
[isaiah658](https://content.minetest.net/users/isaiah658/), which allows us to
train and fight against different monsters. Its gameplay is very similar to
that of a Pokémon from the 90s, since its gameplay is very simple and a little
entertaining.

## To catch, I say tame

Like other video games based on Pokémon, the term catching monsters is not used
for various reasons (I think because it sounds very cruel) and the term
domestication is used. In Zoonami we can tame monsters using various jellies,
which vary depending on the type of monster or its effectiveness.

In Zoonami we can also find villages and fight against trainers, we can even
fight against our friends, which is very similar to a video game of its genre
(Monster Catching).

In conclusion, Zoonami is a very entertaining mod if you like the idea of
training monsters, or also if you want to relive your childhood. Like Minetest,
it is a free mod and can be found in
