Since I was little, I always had a great interest in art and music, since I was
a big fan of Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS, and it's possibly one of the
reasons why I became a programmer. Today, I will tell you about my experience
composing music for a year, although most of that time was just getting
familiar with the DAW.

## My first steps

Before I started composing, I had music classes at my school and I like to
participate in activities that I find fun. My first participation was in a
Christmas song with my classmates, and it was something that made me very happy
and I also met many cool people.

I don't think it's necessary to tell everything, so let's go to the next point.

## Learning to create noise

After spending time with my music classmates and playing several video games, I
thought about whether it was a good idea to create my own music, and so... It
was horrible. The first DAW I used was the free trial of FL Studio because I
found many tutorials on YouTube and it seemed convenient, but let's say I
wasn't good at composing notes and my PC is a toaster.

Later I started developing the video game BioXARZ-2 together with my friends,
which is a project that I have a lot affection for and I hope you love it when
its demo comes out, and it was also one of the reasons why I have improved my
artistic skills.

## My first musical theme

You nay not have known this, but my first non-noise theme was Small File, a
retro-style theme for BioXARZ-2 that was quickly scrapped, it also had poor
mixing and very low volume. Small File was my first theme that I composed with
LMMS and with the help of my friend Ghosty, who is a composer for BioXARZ-2 and
also makes cool music.

Although the theme was scrapped for obvious reasons it concept was not scrapped
and will be given a new purpose in the song Coded File, a kind of opening for
BioXARZ-2 which will also be composed by Ghosty.

## Conclusion

I currently have a lot of BioXARZ-2 themes that I hope to release when it are
finished, and I am also part of the team for a mascot horror video game called
JimnyFood, which is a project of one of my friends.

Personally, Forgotten Dream is a theme that gave me trouble beacause of its
complexity, and remember that the JimnyFood soundtrack doesn't aim to sound
good, it just tries to immerse in the environment.
