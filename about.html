  My name is Guillermo Brito or also known as Alxira5, I am software developer
  and a digital artist, I am also a defender of free culture and that is why
  all my projects are free.
</p>
<p>
  Since I was little, I have had a great interest in machines and fictional
  worlds, this is the reason why I have software development as a profession,
  since for me, creating software is like creating a work of art that will be
  in the hearts of some people. In addition to being a software developer, I am
  also a digital artist and I love making games and conceptual arts.
</p>
<p>
  When I talk about defending free culture, I mean defending the possibility of
  sharing your works with others without the need to take away their freedoms,
  because even if you don't believe it, many of today's works use a free work
  as a basis and are not completely free.
