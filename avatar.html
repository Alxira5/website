  My avatar is the way I present myself on the internet and in turn, a way not
  to show my face. I designed my avatar in
  <a href="https://inkscape.org/" tarjet="_blank">Inkscape</a> a long time ago
  as a way of learning, but I really liked its result and for that reason I
  have used it since then.

  and a very strange smile, which is inspired by the design of some anime
  characters. Also for learning reasons, you can find it with the following

  Being a very simple avatar, I decided to release it into the public domain
  and you can do whatever you want with it, as long as it is with good
  intentions. I recommend using it for informational or learning purposes, and
  in turn I recommend modifying it if you want to use it to represent something
  in particular.
