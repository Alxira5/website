  My name is Guillermo Brito or also known as Alxira5, I am software developer
  and a digital artist, I am also a defender of free culture and that is why
  all my projects are free.

<p>
  This would be my personal website, along with a blog that I usually use as a
  log, which is very common on websites of this type.

<p>It's not a very big place, but it may be of interest to some.</p>
